# Set is a collection of unique elements.
#  Set is mutable. Set is unordered. 
# Set is represented by {}. 
# Set is also called as hash set.

# Creating a set

my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

print(my_set)

my_set.add(11) # Adding an element to the set

print(my_set)

# NOTE: Sets cannot contain duplicate elements. If you try to add a duplicate element to a set, it will not be added to the set.
